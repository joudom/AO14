  This a basic soccer player profile website. My son is the poster player for the project along with his team.
  The project consists of 3 main pages with 1 page dividing into 2 (videos and photos). 
  I'm hoping this project will help gain exposure for my son as he continues his very young soccer journey.
  As a recent bootcamp grad, I also wanted to tie in two of the things I enjoy - sports and coding - in order to build up my portfolio.

  The application is essentialy complete aside from the videos page...which is just a matter of me building some highlight reels to display.
  This project was made with React, React Bootstrap, and some basic CSS.
  Credits to Magnify Branding and <a href="https://github.com/graphicallychallenged">Nyree M</a> for the photos.
